# event-app
This app shows my vision of an event app. It shines with a very clean and smooth UI, and discovery page where users can discover new events in a map view and in a classic list view, a page for all the liked event and a page specially dedicated for the organizer of the events. All the data is fetched in realtime from firebase.
